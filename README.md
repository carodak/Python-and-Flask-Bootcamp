## Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask!
Code that I will upload as I complete the Udemy course called "[Python and Flask Bootcamp: Create Websites using Flask!](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-flask-bootcamp-create-websites-using-flask/)".

## Motivation
This project is for me to learn Flask. At first, I will see the basics of Flask and then SQL Databases with Flask and more advanced things like REST APIs.
I will also review Python (basic and advanced), HTML, CSS and do some automation with Bootstrap 4.

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
1. Install Anaconda Navigator
2. Create your virtual environment using CONDA in the terminal
  - conda create -n myenv python=3.6
  - conda activate myenv
3. Install the libraries
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Install your favorite IDE (I use Atom)
5. Install a local testing server like XAMP
6. Open the files in both your IDE and the local testing server to see the results

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
Open the files in both your IDE and your local testing server to see the results.
